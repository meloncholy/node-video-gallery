Video Gallery
==============

A Metro-style video gallery with Ajax, infinite scroll and other fun stuff. Now rewritten in Node.js. 

There's a load of bumf about the [original PHP version here](http://meloncholy.com/portfolio/video-gallery/) (mostly relevant) and some supplementary info about [this version here](http://meloncholy.com/portfolio/node-video-gallery/). 

[Demo site](http://bits.meloncholy.com/node-video-gallery/)

The front end code is (almost) identical to that in the PHP version. It could do with updating a bit, e.g. to use the HTML5 history API rather than `#!` and moving the jQuery events over to `on`. But other than that it works fine. 


Settings
--------

You'll need to set up a MySQL database first (see sample content below). Then there are some configuration things to do

`/config/app.json` (Please rename `app-sample.json`.)

- **localPort** - Local port to use
- **sessionSecret** - Session secret for Express
- **siteUrl** - Public URL for your site
- **mode** - *development* or *production*. *development* gives more error messages, while *production* uses minimized, combined public JS files that load a lot faster.
- **batchSize** - Number of videos to load at once in infinite scroll.
- **videoCount** - Approximate number of videos in the database. Just used for bragging rights in a few places.
- **cookiePath** - Cookie path to use. Unless you want to restrict it to a subfolder, I'd suggest using `/`.
- **siteTitle** - Name of the site. Used in browser title bar and elsewhere. 
- **siteTitlePost** - Text to stick in the title bar after the video name (where appropriate).
- **siteDescription** - Meta description content.
- **maxRelatedVideos** - If we haven't come via a search (via a link or refresh), show this many related videos at the side of a video.
- **maxSimilarVideos** - Show this many similar videos at the bottom of a video. See video.js for more. This number should obviously work for the largest video size offered.
- **prettyLink** - Prepend this to each video's URL for SEO, so if this were `amazing-stunts`, the URLs would be something like `http://example.com/#!amazing-stunts/name-of-this-video`.
- **jQueryCdnUrl** - In *production* mode, load jQuery from here.
- **gaAccount** - Your Google Analytics UA number.
- **gaDomain** - Your Analytis domain. 

Example

```javascript
{
	"localPort": 3000,
	"sessionSecret": "session secret",
	"siteUrl": "http://bits.meloncholy.com/node-video-gallery/",
	"mode": "development",
	"batchSize": 20,
	"videoCount": 300,
	"cookiePath": "/",
	"siteTitle": "Video Gallery",
	"siteTitlePost": " | Video Gallery",
	"siteDescription": "This Video Gallery is a web app with lots of jQuery and Node goodness. Yum.",
	"maxRelatedVideos": 19,
	"maxSimilarVideos": 7,
	"prettyLink": "video",
	"jQueryCdnUrl": "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js",
	"gaAccount": "UA-XXXXXXXX-X",
	"gaDomain": "meloncholy.com"
}
```

`/config/database.json`

- **host** - Database host
- **database** - Database name
- **user** - Database user
- **password** - Database password

Example

```javascript
{
	"host": "localhost",
	"database": "database",
	"user": "user",
	"password": "password"
}
```

Dependencies
------------

To get it to work, you'll also need

- [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express)
- [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)
- [Konphyg](https://github.com/pgte/konphyg)
- [VidStreamer.js](https://github.com/meloncholy/vid-streamer)


Sample content
--------------

If you want to get going quickly, you can use the sample videos, photos and database from the [PHP Video Gallery](https://github.com/meloncholy/video-gallery) (placeholder and database folders resp.). 

And try something like this for `vidStreamer.json` (in `/node_modules/vid-streamer/config`) to get it to serve up the sample content. 

```javascript
{
	"mode": "development",
	"forceDownload": false,
	"random": true,
	"rootFolder": "/path/to/express/public/",
	"rootPath": "node-video-gallery/",
	"server": "VidStreamer.js/0.1"
}
```
